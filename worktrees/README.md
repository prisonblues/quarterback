# Worktree-per-issue workflow

The tooling in this directory is **not part of the quarterback service**. It is the
workflow the board was built alongside, published here because the two solve adjacent
halves of the same problem and the second half makes little sense without the first.

Short version: **worktrees isolate agents from each other; the board reconnects them.**

- `commands/` — Claude Code slash commands (`/fix-issue`, `/drop-worktree`, `/tree-shake`)
- `scripts/` — the bash the commands drive (`create-worktree`, `remove-worktree`, `prune-worktrees`)
- `worktree.example.json` — per-repo config, annotated with quarterback's own values

## The problem this solves

Run one coding agent on a repo and nothing is required beyond a checkout. Run a second
one at the same time and everything collides at once: both edit the same files, both run
migrations against the same database, both bind port 8000, both leave the tree dirty for
the other. The usual answer — "just wait your turn" — throws away the reason you wanted
two agents.

A git worktree fixes the files. It does not fix the database, the containers, the ports,
or the local scaffolding (`.venv`, `.claude`, `CLAUDE.md`) that a checkout needs to be
usable. `create-worktree` does the rest, so an agent gets a genuinely independent place to
work in one command.

## What each piece does

### `/fix-issue <number>` — the driver

End-to-end resolution of a GitHub issue in a dedicated worktree. Reads the issue, plans,
**decides whether the change needs an isolated database copy**, provisions a worktree,
implements, writes tests, updates docs, runs the project's real CI checks, self-reviews the
diff (optionally with `codex` as a second opinion), commits, pushes, opens a PR, and
comments on the issue.

Two decisions in it are worth lifting out, because they are the ones that bite:

- **DB mode.** Schema changes and data writes get an isolated copy; read-only work shares
  the main database because copying is slow. If it can't tell, it picks isolated. There is
  a guard for the case where it chose `shared` and *then* discovered it needs a migration —
  it stops and asks rather than mutating the shared database.
- **The worktree is left in place** when the PR opens, so review findings can be addressed
  on the same branch and the same database. Teardown is a separate, deliberate act.

### `/drop-worktree` — teardown, keep the branch

Destroys the worktree this session owns and all its trappings — containers, nginx block,
isolated DB, port entry, directory — but keeps the branch and its commits. Refuses to run
on a dirty tree, and warns if the branch has never been pushed.

### `/tree-shake` — sweep the debris

Worktrees removed badly leave orphans: databases with no worktree, stale port entries,
leftover directories, containers, nginx blocks. `/tree-shake` first offers to tear down
*finished* worktrees properly (merged PRs), then dry-runs an orphan sweep and applies only
what you confirm.

### The scripts

`create-worktree` is the substantial one. It provisions the directory, symlinks shared
local state, copies configured data, clones the database, wires Docker and nginx, and
allocates a port. `remove-worktree` reverses it. `prune-worktrees` is the orphan sweeper —
it is the only one that is dry-run by default.

The commands are thin, guarded drivers over these. The scripts hold the deterministic
logic on purpose: a model deciding *which* worktree to destroy is fine, a model
hand-rolling `docker rm` / `dropdb` / `rm -rf` is not.

## How it works

- **Layout.** A worktree is a *sibling* of the main checkout: `../<project>-<branch>`, with
  `/` in the branch name flattened to `-`. So `fix/issue-42` in `~/src/myapp` becomes
  `~/src/myapp-fix-issue-42`.
- **Ports.** Allocated from `base_port` upward and recorded in `.worktree-ports` in the main
  checkout. A port already bound is skipped even if the file doesn't know about it.
- **Database.** An isolated copy is named `<project>_<branch>`, cloned from the main
  database, with the worktree's `.env` rewritten to point at it. `create-worktree` has a
  safety net that shouts if any `.env` var still names the main database after rewriting —
  if you see that warning, stop, because a migration would hit shared data.
- **Shared local state.** `.venv`, `.claude` and `CLAUDE.md` are symlinked back to the main
  checkout so the worktree is immediately usable. Git-*tracked* directories are handled
  carefully rather than symlinked wholesale — see the comments in `create-worktree`, which
  record two real incidents that motivated the defensive code.
- **Session marker.** `/fix-issue` writes the worktree path to
  `~/.cache/claude-code/session-cwd/$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`. This exists because the shell
  cwd resets between tool calls, so a plain `cd` does not stick; the marker is how the
  statusline and `/drop-worktree` know which worktree a session owns.

## Configuration

Drop a `.worktree.json` in your repo root. Every key is optional — Docker, nginx and the
database are auto-detected, and anything absent is skipped, so a plain library repo gets a
worktree and symlinks and nothing else. See `worktree.example.json`, which is filled in with
quarterback's own values.

Keys the script reads: `project`, `framework`, `base_port`, `app_port`,
`docker.{enabled,network_pattern,network_default,image_pattern}`,
`database.{engine,container,url_env,user_env,password_env,name_env}`,
`worker.{type,command,container_prefix,queue_env,queue_default}`,
`nginx.{config,container,main_port,resolver,extra_proxy_headers}`,
`server.{workers_env,workers_default}`, `env.copy_from`, `workspace.{enabled,editor_cli}`,
and the arrays `symlinks`, `copies`, `reserved_names`, `gitignore_additions`.

## How this relates to quarterback

The two answer different questions, and it is worth being precise about which:

|  | Worktree tooling | quarterback |
|---|---|---|
| **Question** | How do two agents work at once without destroying each other? | Who is doing what, where, and is my checkout current? |
| **Scope** | One machine | Across machines and agents |
| **Failure it prevents** | Physical collision — files, database, ports, containers | Informational collision — duplicated work, stale checkouts |

### Using the worktrees instead

If your problem is *"my agent's half-finished refactor means I can't touch anything else"*,
you need worktrees and you do not need a board. quarterback isolates nothing — it will
happily watch two agents overwrite each other and report both. Plenty of people should
start with `create-worktree`, stop there, and never run the service.

The board only starts earning its keep when there is a second agent whose work you cannot
see, or a second machine whose commits you do not have.

### Using them together

Isolation buys safety and immediately creates a new problem: **invisibility**. Once every
agent sits in its own directory, on its own branch, against its own database, nobody can
see anyone. Two agents can spend an afternoon solving the same bug in adjacent directories
and never find out. That gap is the one the board fills, and several of its endpoints exist
specifically because of this workflow:

- **`report_git` / `GET /worktrees` / `find_commit`** — a registry of exactly the worktrees
  `create-worktree` produces, across every device. Same-machine worktrees share a git object
  store, so cherry-picking between them is purely a *discovery* problem: which SHA exists
  where, and what does it do. That is what `find_commit` answers.
- **`GET /active?cwd=`** — "who is live in this directory?" The directories in question are
  worktrees. Ask before you dive in.
- **`GET /overlap` / the `peers` tool** — leases carry repo and branch, so the board can rank
  live peers by subject overlap and point you at the agent already on your problem. Without
  it, worktree isolation means you would never have met.
- **`published` posts and `GET /sync`** — `/fix-issue` pushes a branch and opens a PR. When
  that PR merges, other checkouts silently go stale. The board's publish/staleness advisories
  are what turn "somebody should remember to pull" into something nobody has to remember.

The honest summary: **`create-worktree` makes agents safe to run in parallel; quarterback
makes parallel agents aware of each other.** Adopt the first when one agent is in your way.
Adopt the second when you can no longer tell what the others are doing.

## Installing

The scripts are plain bash with no build step. Put them somewhere on `PATH`:

```bash
install -m 0755 worktrees/scripts/* ~/.local/bin/
```

The commands are Claude Code slash commands — copy them where Claude Code looks for
commands (`~/.claude/commands/` for global, `.claude/commands/` for per-project):

```bash
cp worktrees/commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/
```

Requirements: `git`, `jq`, `bash`. `docker` and a database client only if your repo uses
them; `gh` for `/fix-issue` and `/tree-shake`, which talk to GitHub.

## Caveats

Read these before adopting rather than after.

- **These are vendored copies.** They are maintained in the author's personal machine
  config, and this directory is a snapshot. It will drift. Treat it as a starting point to
  adapt, not a dependency to track.
- **The commands assume Claude Code**, specifically `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` and the
  session-marker convention above. The *scripts* have no such dependency and are useful on
  their own from a normal shell.
- **The database copy assumes PostgreSQL in a container.** Other engines are configurable in
  principle but far less exercised.
- **Pin `database.container` if the machine runs more than one Postgres.** Left at `auto`,
  the scripts look for a running container whose name matches `postgres|pgdb|_db`. They now
  prefer stable human-named containers over hex-prefixed ephemeral ones and verify the
  candidate actually answers as your DB user — but "guess the container" is still a guess.
  On a host also running self-hosted CI it originally picked a runner's throwaway
  `<hex>_postgres16_<hex>` service, which made `create-worktree` fail with `role "..." does
  not exist` and, worse, made `prune-worktrees` report `Orphan databases: none` while a
  hundred orphans sat in the real container. An explicit name (as in
  `worktree.example.json`) removes the ambiguity entirely.
- **`/fix-issue` references commands not included here** — `/review-pr`, `/panel-review-pr`,
  `/epic`, `/fix-issue-here`. Those references are inert; the command works without them,
  it will just mention things you do not have.
- **`/fix-issue` does not stop to ask.** It plans, implements, pushes and opens a PR in one
  run. That is the point of it, and it is also the reason to read it before pointing it at
  a repo you care about.
- **`prune-worktrees` is dry-run by default; the other two are not.** `remove-worktree`
  destroys on invocation.
